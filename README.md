# Todo List
Todo List for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

<b>2023-02-05 Update Note:</b> the small screen menu should be redone, since I was very much improvising on how to approach this problem at the time of making the project. However, instead of updating the current project, I am considering rebuilding it in the future with React and ViteJS.
